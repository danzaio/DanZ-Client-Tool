\</p\>

Hey folks,

I'm happy to be releasing the DanZ Client Tool\! It revitalizes many features from the original KBot concept. This significant update, while ensuring constant updates and a new UI, was primarily focused on **enhancing its operational discretion**. It‚Äôs free, remains in active development, and more stuff is soon to come :)

This tool is a Python-based application designed to interact with the League of Legends Client (LCU) to provide various enhancements, automation, and information retrieval features. It's a full port of the original KBot concept to Python, using Tkinter and CustomTkinter for the GUI.

The release is currently available on this GitHub repository. I'll be updating this page with more screenshots and details soon.

**Important Note: Closed Source & Obfuscation**

The distributed version of DanZ Client Tool is **closed-source and obfuscated**. This decision was made primarily to **discourage malicious actors from taking the code, adding unauthorized authentication systems, and attempting to sell it on shady Discord servers or other platforms.** This tool is intended to be free for the community and will always remain so.

While the source isn't publicly available by default, I'm committed to transparency for those with genuine interest or concerns. If you have any doubts about how a specific feature works, or if you're a developer interested in understanding parts of the codebase, please feel free to DM me ‚Äì I'll happily share relevant source snippets or explanations. Furthermore, if there's strong community interest and consensus, I'm open to fully open-sourcing the project in the future.
